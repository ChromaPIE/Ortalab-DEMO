# Ortalab Mod Demo

## Description
This mod adds 45 Reverse Jokers, 22 Loteria cards (Reverse Tarots), 18 Reverse Spectral cards, 32 Reverse Vouchers, 15 Decks, 30 Bets (Reverse Blinds), 4 new Editions, 4 Curses (Reverse Seals), and 8 new card Enhancements

## How to Install
This mod requires the [Steamodded Mod loader](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) ver. 0.9.2 or higher. Download the zip file of newest release, and copy the `ReverseBalatro` file into `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods`, and launch the game. 

## To Do
- Update textures for already complete jokers
- Add seed logic to all the current randomness uses for jokers
- Add more Jokers

## Knows Issues
- Prol√©taire's code breaks some boss blind mechanics (specifically card flipping). Haven't had the chance to fix yet. 
- Virus can select cards that are already converted (this is not intended).
